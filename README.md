# 👋 Hey there, I'm Raiyan Ahmed (a.k.a. Ray 🤳)!

<i style="display:block;text-align:center;font-size:1.5rem;"> 🚀 Versatile Developer | ⇄ JSON<sup>ist</sup> | 🌈 Dream Chaser | 🏡 Based in 127.0.0.1

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm not your average developer - I'm more a guy who would spend time more in making adblocker than making ads.🤞

### 🎭 About Me

- 🧠 Full Stack Developer in training, because why limit myself to just one stack when I can have them all? I don't want peace, i want [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrqDZ5CP3cA) always
- 🎓 Completed BSc in Computer Science During day Time, code wizard by night but now, I am Full Time Batman.
- 💻 Turning caffeine into code since 2021 talking about dedicated time.
- I live in-between those [JSON](https://www.json.org/)

### 🛠️ Tech Arsenal

- 💻 HTML/CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, SQL - I speak more languages than a United Nations interpreter!
- 🔧 React, MongoDB, Git - Because one tool is never enough
- 🎨 Figma, Adobe XD, Canva - Making the web pretty, one pixel at a time. Ahem! penpot and lunacy can be in list While Adobe XD can leave.

### 📚 Currently I am Learning:

- PostgreSQL - without relation, everyone is stranger to each other
- Java - Just for DSA and LeetCode Grinding to Achieve ratio of 100:75:50 
- JS - It has no destination aye

### 🚀 Mission Impossible

I'm on a quest to land a life-changing job and create the next big thing. Think "reinventing the wheel," but cooler. Maybe I'll revolutionize drink with new machine which gives combination of hot chocolate with caffeine , Tea flavour and herbal properties? Or create an app that finally explains why the chicken crossed the road? The possibilities are endless!

### 🏆 Achievements

- Completed JavaScript Essential Training - now my code is 60% less likely to spontaneously combust
- Survived a MongoDB Essential Training without turning into a database myself
- Mastered the art of Tailwind CSS - now I can make websites pretty in 73 different shades of blue & ruin HTML file instead of .CSS file

P.S. If you're wondering why this README is so awesome, it's because I poured my heart, soul, [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and at least three cups of coffee into it. Enjoy! ☕️☕️☕️
